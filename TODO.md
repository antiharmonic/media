- IMDB (and perhaps eventually goodreads, metacritic, etc) integration for autofill and posters
- filter page for non-quick queries
- and maybe track filters ran to make more quick-queries
- pass quick query name to list page as a page header
- further customization of datatables
- view page or just keep edit page and upon save go back to the previous filter?
- integration data pop up upon datatables hover
- search auto fill?
- SQLAlchemy 1.4 broke records (at least my implementation). Need to move away from records to something else I guess.
  - Using SQLAlchemy 1.1 exactly in Pipfile for now.
- year in review cards + fast query link from the card - interesting to see everything i did in 2020 e.g.
- add media_type to the possible query values
